  "description": "PedigreePal aims to develop a decentralized, secure, and easily accessible system for storing and verifying dog pedigree (ancestry) and ownership information. By leveraging blockchain technology and integrating it with existing pet microchip technology, we will create a user-friendly dApp (decentralized application) that will allow users to access a dog's pedigree information and prove the authenticity of their breed, regardless of location or kennel club membership. The system will also enable veterinarians to access owner information in case a dog is lost or requires medical attention.",
